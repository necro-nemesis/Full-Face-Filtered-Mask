The Full-Face-Filtered-Mask has been deigned to utilize the Intersurgical 1745000 or similar 22 mm tapered inlet style filter fitted to the Hydro-Swim Seaclear Vista Snorkeling Mask manufactured by Bestway www.bestwaycorp.com/support.

I have provided .stl files for quick access to 3d printing. Additionally I have provided STEP and SAT files for the ability to work on other adaptations. No support material is required to print. I have printed the files at various layer heights and have had a working part at .3mm layer height with a .4mm nozzel if time is critical although fitment is better at higher resolutions if you have the luxury of time to print them. .2mm layer height is a good compromise. It is recommended to use PLA due to it's inert nature.

The blow out valve plug is optional as the valve when working correctly is designed to only allow air to exit however I have included a plug design as will to block the front blowout port. It is a snap in design which when installed directs all airflow in and out the filtered port.

The project commenced in response to identifiable shortages in ventilators and related equipment during the outbreak of COVID 19d.
